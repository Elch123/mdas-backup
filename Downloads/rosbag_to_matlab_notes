CONVERSION OF NUMERICAL DATA IN ROSBAGS:
Wyatt Newman, 11/10/17

process:

clone cwru_scripts:
git clone https://github.com/cwru-robotics/cwru_scripts.git
  drag the package "rosbag_to_matlab" to the ros_ws/src directory
  from ros_ws, run: catkin_make
  
may need to install scipy:
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose
(not sure if this is needed for bag_to_csv)

download the bagfile of interest. Note the directory.  E.g., if the directory is:
/home/data, then (in a terminal window) cd to this directory: cd /home/data

run the conversion command on the file of interest.  

   rosrun rosbag_to_matlab bag_to_mat.py ./circle1.bag .

   this produces: circle1__gps_fix_psr.mat and circle1__received_messages.mat
   
  run this matlab script, analyze_circles.m (from data directory):
  
  clear all
load circle1__gps_fix_psr.mat
deg_lat_2_m = 111064;
deg_lon_2_m = 83490;
[npts,cols] = size(data);
lat = data(2:npts,7);
lon = data(2:npts,8);

lat_start = mean(lat(2:10))
lon_start = mean(lon(2:10))
dx = (lon - lon_start)*deg_lon_2_m;
dy = (lat - lat_start)*deg_lat_2_m;
figure(1)
clf
plot(dx,dy)
xlabel('dx')
ylabel('dy')
title('circle1')
grid

 this produces the plot shown in "circle1.jpg"

   
Also tried alternative CSV file conversion, which also worked.

 Run CSV file conversion.  E.g., with file "circle1.bag", after navigating to the directory in which
 this file resides, run:
 
   rosrun rosbag_to_matlab bag_to_csv.sh  ./circle1.bag .
 
 This produces output files: gps_fix_psr.csv  received_messages.csv
 (since only these 2 topics were recorded for the circle move)
 
 The gps latitude is in column 7, and the longitude is in column 8
 NOTE: first row of data is invalid; need to ignore it
 
 --------interpretation-------------

lat/lon of CWRU: 41.504607, -81.609735

per: https://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/Calculators/degree.html

111064 meters per degree latitude
83490 meters per degree of longitude (at 41.5-deg north)

rosbag has 10 decimal places of lat/lon (requires 7 decimal places for 1cm resolution)

Ran the following matlab file (actually, only attempted in QtOctave, which is typically consistent with Matlab)
See the file: analyze_circles_csv.m
text of which is below:

x = csvread ("gps_fix_psr.csv")
deg_lat_2_m = 111064;
deg_lon_2_m = 83490;
[npts,cols] = size(x);
lat = x(2:npts,7);
lon = x(2:npts,8);

lat_start = mean(lat(2:10))
lon_start = mean(lon(2:10))
dx = (lon - lon_start)*deg_lon_2_m;
dy = (lat - lat_start)*deg_lat_2_m;
figure(1)
clf
plot(dx,dy)
xlabel('dx')
ylabel('dy')
title('circle1')
grid

This strips off the first row of data, establishes a start point (lat/lon), converts lat/lon to delta lat/lon
from this start point, then converts these to dx,dy in meters and plots the result.
